function M = nexpsamp(N)
%NEXPSAMP  Computes number of samples for an exponentially resampled signal
%   M = NEXPSAMP(N) computes the maximum number of samples required to keep
%   the smallest sampling rate in an exponentially resampled signal
%   larger than the original uniform nyquist rate.
%
%   INPUTS:
%      N: A K-by-1 vector of samples lengths in the uniform domain.
%
%   OUTPUTS:
%      M: A K-by-1 vector of samples lengths in the exponential domain.
