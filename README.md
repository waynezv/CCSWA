This repository is based on research work in guided wave nondestructive testing and structural health monitoring. Specifically, research work initially on Lamb waves. The repository contains code for performing fast temperature compensation of waves through the use of the Mellin or scale transform. The repository also contains code for extracting the frequency-wavenumber, or dispersion curve, representation of Lamb waves (or any other waves characterized by dispersion curves) and using the frequency-wavenumber representation to perform high-resolution localization. 

Folders
====

The repository currently contains four folders: 

  * **ddmfp-tools**: MATLAB code base for extract and utilizing the frequency-wavenumber, or dispersion curve, representations of waves
  * **mellin-tools**: MATLAB code base for the Mellin transform, which can be used to compensate for temperature affects in guided waves. 
  * **dsp-tools**: MATLAB code base of miscellaneous functions to support the other folders.
  * **demos**:  MATALB demonstrations of the functions presented in the other folders.
